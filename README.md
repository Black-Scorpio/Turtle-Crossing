# Turtle Crossing Game
This is a simple Turtle Crossing game implemented using Python's Turtle graphics library. The objective of the game is to move the turtle from the starting position to the finish line while avoiding the moving cars.

## Prerequisites
Python 3.x
Turtle graphics library (usually included with Python)

## How to Run
Clone the repository or download the source code files.

Ensure all the files (main.py, player.py, car_manager.py, and scoreboard.py) are in the same directory.

Open a terminal or command prompt and navigate to the directory containing the files.

Run the following command:

```sh
python main.py
```

## How to Play
Use the 'W' key to move the turtle up.
Use the 'S' key to move the turtle down.
The objective is to reach the top of the screen without colliding with any cars.
If the turtle reaches the top, the game levels up, and the cars move faster.
If the turtle collides with a car, the game is over.
